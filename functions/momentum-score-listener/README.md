# Momentum Score Listener

Edge Function that listens to momentum score changes and triggers AI coaching interventions.

## Purpose

This function implements **M1.3.6 - Momentum Integration & Proactive Nudge** by:

1. Listening to `daily_engagement_scores` table inserts via Supabase webhooks
2. Detecting momentum state changes (Rising, Steady, NeedsCare)
3. Triggering AI coaching responses for state transitions
4. Sending push notifications via FCM
5. Storing coaching notifications for Today Feed integration

## Setup
