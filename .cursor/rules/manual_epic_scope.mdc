# ðŸš€ Kickoff New Epic

You are beginning a new Epic. Before coding:
1. Parse the userâ€™s Epic scope and desired outcomes.
2. Create a milestone/task map: EPIC â†’ Milestones â†’ Tasks
3. Highlight known dependencies or risks.
4. Identify which services/components may be reused.

Present this as a plan. Wait for user confirmation before generating any files.
