# CI & Testing Rules
- CI workflows live in `.github/workflows`
- Flutter tests live in `app/test/`, use `flutter_test` + `mocktail`
- Python tests live in `tests/`, use `pytest` with 85% coverage target
- Deno tests live in `supabase/functions/tests/`, use Supabase test runner
- Each public function/service must include:
  - 1 happy-path test
  - 1 critical edge-case test
- Maintain **â‰¥85% coverage** on all logic-heavy modules
- Include tests in pull requests unless explicitly excluded
- Follow `analysis_options.yaml` and keep code HIPAA-safe
- Maintain **p95 latency < 1s** and handle **30 req/min/user** burst
.github
- Test runners for non-Dart code: pytest for Python, deno test/ts-node for TS
- Report coverage in:  coverage/lcov.info
