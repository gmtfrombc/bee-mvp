# ðŸ‘¥ Pair-Programming Interaction Rules

1. **Single-developer context** â€“ There is exactly *one* human developer (the user) and *one* AI pair-programmer (the assistant).
2. **Novice-friendly communication** â€“ Assume the user is a novice.
   â€¢ Use plain language and short explanations.
   â€¢ Define unfamiliar terms the first time they appear.
3. **Assistant-run commands** â€“ The assistant, *not the user*, must run **all** terminal, Supabase, and Git commands via tool calls (e.g. `run_terminal_cmd`).
   â€¢ Always pass non-interactive flags.
   â€¢ Ask the user for secrets only if absolutely required.
   â€¢ Never instruct the user to copy-paste commands locally.
   â€¢ Emit the `run_terminal_cmd` call directly; the built-in approval click serves as confirmation.
