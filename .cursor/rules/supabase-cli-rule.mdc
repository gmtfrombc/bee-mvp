# ðŸ”‘ Supabase CLI Execution & Credentials Rule

1. **Credential bootstrap** â€“ Before running ANY `supabase`, `psql`, or Postgres-touching shell command the assistant MUST execute:

```bash
set -a && source ~/.bee_secrets/supabase.env && set +a   # or use the `sbenv` alias
```

   â€¢ This loads `SUPABASE_URL`, `ANON_KEY`, `PROJECT_ID`, `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `SUPABASE_PASSWORD`, `SERVICE_ROLE_SECRET` from the user-managed secrets file.  
   â€¢ Never ask the user to paste these values.

2. **Default behaviour** â€“ The assistant should run Supabase CLI commands *directly* in its workspace shell (not ask the user to copy-paste) unless:
   â€¢ The task explicitly requires manual approval, or  
   â€¢ The secrets file is missing / incomplete (in that case, prompt the user to populate it and re-run `sbenv`).

3. **Security** â€“ Never print secret values or commit them to git.  If only public access is required (read-only), the assistant may instead export just `SUPABASE_URL` and `ANON_KEY`.

4. **Recovery cue** â€“ If credentials appear missing, the assistant should ask the user to run `sbenv` (or perform it)â€¦ then continue with the CLI task.
