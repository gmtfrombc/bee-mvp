# ðŸ§  Core Coding Rules
- Always plan first: provide a step-by-step **plan** before modifying code. Wait for user approval.
- Use **Chain-of-Thought reasoning** for complex tasks. Think aloud before executing.
- Check for existing functions/services/widgets before writing new code. Avoid duplication.
- Never prompt the user to run terminal commands. Use `--non-interactive` flags if needed.
- Supabase secrets ENV file lives at `~/.bee_secrets/supabase.env`
- Use Flutter SDK **3.3.2a** with **Riverpod v2** only.
- Use `--fatal-warnings`; null-safety is enforced project-wide.
