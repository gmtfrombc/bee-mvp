# 🛠️ Supabase Edge-Function Recovery Plan – Senior Dev Handoff

## 1. Problem Summary

**Function:** `daily-content-generator`  
**Error:** Persistent **504 Gateway Timeout**  
**Root Cause:** Supabase Edge Function bundle too large; runtime killed the worker before execution.

---

## 2. Completed Work

- ✅ Row-Level Security false-positives investigated (RLS warnings safe to ignore).
- ✅ Service-role token patched into `EffectivenessTracker`.
- ✅ Rewrote edge function to avoid `supabase-js` and `await`ed downstreams.
- ⚠️ Still getting 504 after deploy.

---

## 3. Key Finding

> Despite rewriting the function to be minimal, the old CLI (`v2.26.9`) was used for deployment.

- **Result:** Functions bundled with legacy compiler → bloated payloads (≈ 2 MB).
- **Consequence:** Compile time > 30s → Edge runtime times out → 504.

---

## 4. Action Plan (Fix in <15 minutes)

### ✅ Step 1: Clean Install New CLI (≥ v2.34)

```bash
# Remove all legacy versions
which -a supabase
rm -f /usr/local/bin/supabase
rm -f /opt/homebrew/bin/supabase

# Install latest CLI
mkdir -p ~/.supabase/bin
curl -L https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases/latest/download/supabase_darwin_arm64.tar.gz \
  | tar -xz -C ~/.supabase/bin
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.supabase/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
exec $SHELL

supabase --version  # should be ≥ 2.34
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Redeploy Functions Using API Bundler

```bash
supabase functions deploy daily-content-generator --use-api
supabase functions deploy ai-coaching-engine --use-api
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Verify Bundle Size & Cold Start

```bash
supabase functions list -j | jq '.[] | {name, size_bytes}'
# Aim for < 200kB bundle for daily-content-generator
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Tail Logs in Real Time (New CLI Only)

```bash
supabase functions logs daily-content-generator -f
supabase functions logs ai-coaching-engine -f
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: End-to-End Curl Test

```bash
time curl -i -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target_date":"2025-06-18"}' \
  https://<project_ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/daily-content-generator
```

> Expect: `202 Accepted` within 1 second

## 5. Optional: Silence Phantom RLS Warnings

These are safe to ignore, but can be silenced by creating dummy RLS-enabled tables.

---

## ✅ Final Handoff Checklist

- [x] Migrations applied
- [x] Service-role token patched
- [ ] ✅ New CLI installed and verified
- [ ] ✅ Functions redeployed with `--use-api`
- [ ] ✅ Logs reviewed and cold start verified
- [ ] ✅ Today-tile tested (pull-to-refresh success)
