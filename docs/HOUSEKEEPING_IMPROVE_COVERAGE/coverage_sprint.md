# Sprint: Improve Test Coverage to 60%

**Context** Current filtered coverage is ~44 %. The immediate CI threshold has
been lowered to 40 % to unblock pipelines. This sprint raises coverage
incrementally so the original 60 % bar can be re-established.

## Objectives

1. Raise overall line coverage from 44 % → 60 %.
2. Establish patch-level gating so new code cannot drop coverage.

## Tasks

| ID | Description                                                                                                 | Owner | Status  |
| -- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------- |
| T1 | Generate HTML coverage report (`genhtml coverage/lcov.info`) and list top 20 un-covered files               |       | pending |
| T2 | Write unit tests for high-ROI service files in `lib/core/services/*` (aim ≥ 800 covered lines)              |       | pending |

| T4 | Add at least one widget (golden + interaction) test per top-level screen in `lib/features/**/presentation/` |       | pending |
| T5 | Configure Codecov “patch” status so PRs cannot decrease coverage on modified lines                          |       | pending |
| T6 | Raise CI threshold to 45 %, 50 %, 55 %, 60 % in successive PRs as coverage improves                         |       | pending |
