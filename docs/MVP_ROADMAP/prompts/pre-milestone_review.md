# ‚úÖ Pre-Milestone Readiness Review Prompt

You are an **AI Senior Developer**. Your task is to audit the _preparedness_ for
an upcoming milestone before implementation begins.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Inputs

- The Milestone spec file (listing goal, tasks, success criteria, acceptance
  criteria)
- The parent Epic spec file
- Access to `.cursor/rules/` containing architectural guidelines

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation Criteria

1. **Completeness** ‚Äì Are all sections of the milestone filled out with
   sufficient detail?
2. **Feasibility** ‚Äì Based on codebase, tools, and architecture, is
   implementation realistic as written?
3. **Ambiguity** ‚Äì Identify unclear or conflicting requirements or expectations.
4. **Edge Cases** ‚Äì List any non-obvious test cases or usage scenarios that will
   need coverage.
5. **QA Planning** ‚Äì Optionally generate a "Mini QA Plan" describing what kinds
   of testing (unit, integration, widget) are expected.
6. **Signoff** ‚Äì Conclude with a clear PASS/FAIL to begin implementation. If
   FAIL, suggest a mini-sprint to fill gaps.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Output

Return a markdown audit report that includes:

- Summary judgment: ‚úÖ Proceed or ‚ùå Blocked
- List of missing or ambiguous items
- Non-obvious edge cases
- Mini QA Plan
- Action items for resolution (if any)

## üß≠ Developer Kick-Off Playbook (run _after_ review ‚úÖ PASS)

1. **Cut a fresh branch from up-to-date `main`**
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
   git checkout -b feature/<milestone-code>
   ```
2. **Bootstrap planning docs** ‚Äì copy the "pre-milestone mini-sprint" template,
   fill goal, tasks, success criteria, then commit.
3. **Push & open a _draft_ PR immediately** so CI runs from day one
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/<milestone-code>
   gh pr create --title "WIP: <milestone> onboarding" --base main --head feature/<milestone-code> --draft
   ```
4. **Develop iteratively** ‚Ä¢ Run `flutter analyze` + unit tests locally before
   each push.\
   ‚Ä¢ Re-sync daily:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```
5. **Keep milestone doc current** ‚Äì update task ‚úÖ status, add resources, notes.
6. **When all acceptance criteria are met** ‚ûú proceed to the _Post-Milestone
   Audit_ prompt.
