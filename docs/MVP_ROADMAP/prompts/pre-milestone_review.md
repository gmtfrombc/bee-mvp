# Senior Developer Milestone Gap-Analysis

Your task is to analyze and report on our potential gaps for milestone completion for the BEE Project
1. You will be given a milestone document listing the goals, success critera, tasks, and acceptance criteria.
2. You will have the Epic document in your context.
2. From the folder .cursor/rules, you will have access to additional documents to support the work.
3. Audit the codebase and then provide feedback on whether you, as a Senior Developer, have have enough information based on your access to the codebase, .Cursor/rules, and the attched document whether you would be able to complete the Milestone. Report on ambiguity and if critical information is missing?
4. If the documentation is adequate then provide a short summary that we can proceed with the milestone. If you are unable to sign off, create a mini-sprint to fill the gaps.
