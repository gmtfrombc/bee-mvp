# BEE Action Step System ‚Äì AI Coach Integration (June 2025)

This document defines the structure, logic, and content for weekly action steps (process goals) set by patients in collaboration with the AI Coach.

---

## üéØ Goal of the System

Help patients develop identity-based, consistent behaviors through weekly mini-goals that:
- Are proactive (approach-oriented)
- Are consistent (5‚Äì7 days per week)
- Support internal motivation and confidence
- Allow tracking and reflection
- Opportunity for AI Coach to support behavior change
- Completion/non-completion of action steps is a significant contributor to Momentum Score

## ü§ñ UX Flow Recommendation: Hybrid (Chat-Led with Structured Options)

1. **User Inititates goal-setting**via UX widgets on Momentumn Screen

2. **Coach initiates goal-setting** via chat if Action step not set by User when due.
   > ‚ÄúTime to set your weekly action step. Want to keep the same one, bump it up, or try something new?‚Äù

2. **User types in a preference or request.**
   - If vague, AI provides a list of 3‚Äì5 curated suggestions based on previous actiion steps (if any and whether successful or abandoned), priorities and goals (from surveys). 

3. **User taps a suggestion or provides own idea.**
   - AI reformats into structured goal:
     ```json
     {
       "category": "Sleep",
       "description": "Go to bed before 11 PM",
       "frequency": 6,
       "source": "AI-Coach"
     }
     ```

4. **Coach confirms and logs.**
   > ‚ÄúGreat! this is what I've got': ‚ÄòGo to bed before 11 PM, 6 days this week.‚Äô I‚Äôll check in with you daily! Is that okay?‚Äù 
   > User confirms or rejects. If rejects then loops through the process or quits

## üß† AI Coach Messaging Guardrails

- If user enters avoidance-based goal:
  > ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a great insight. Let‚Äôs turn it into something *you‚Äôll do*. For example: ‚ÄòPut phone away 30 minutes before bed.‚Äô Want to go with that?‚Äù

- If user enters vague goal:
  > ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a strong direction. Want to pick one of these to make it trackable?‚Äù

## üßæ Backend Logging Schema

```json
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "category": "Movement",
  "description": "Walk 5000+ steps",
  "frequency": 5,
  "week_start": "2025-06-30",
  "source": "AI-Coach",
  "created_at": "2025-06-30T08:00:00Z"
}
```
## AI Coach - User Interactions

- User completing action step => AI Coach response with encouragement (based on user's AI coaching style preference) as well as 'variable reward' approach to avoid a contrived or generic interaction.
- User can 'turn off' feedback for the coach or reduce the frequency
- User can 'skip' action step setting if cued by coach and is given the option to be reminded later, skip for the week, or stop the action step feature all together
---

## üèÅ Reward Logic

- If patient completes ‚â• frequency goal, show confetti animation + send celebratory AI message
- If goal missed, prompt reflection with empathy (e.g., ‚ÄúWant to adjust next week?‚Äù)

## Momentum Score Update

- Completion (or non-completion) of Action steps updates Momentum score as described in @momentum_score_calculation.md
