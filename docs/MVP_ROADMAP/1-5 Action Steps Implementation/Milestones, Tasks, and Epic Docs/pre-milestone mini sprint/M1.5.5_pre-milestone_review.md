## Summary Judgment

✅ **Proceed** – Milestone is generally well-defined and technically feasible. A
few clarifications and minor scope adjustments are recommended but are **not**
blocking.

---

## 1. Missing / Ambiguous Items

| # | Observation                                                                                                                                                                                  | Recommended Action                                                                    |
| - | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **Coach copy variants** – languages/locales supported and exact placement in UI are unspecified.                                                                                             | Document localization keys and UI entry points.                                       |
| 2 | **Analytics schema** – only three payload keys (`user_id`, `action_step_id`, `status`) listed. Additional context (timestamp, frequency, category) may be required for downstream analytics. | Publish full Amplitude event spec before implementation.                              |
| 3 | **Performance metric collection** – requirement "≤ 16 ms/frame" lacks measurement methodology.                                                                                               | Define test device list and tooling (e.g. `flutter run --profile` with `--timeline`). |
| 4 | **Time estimates** – 2 h for a WCAG AA audit + fixes (T4) is likely optimistic.                                                                                                              | Re-estimate to 4 h or split into audit + fix sub-tasks.                               |
| 5 | **`ActionStepCompletionController` availability** – referenced as dependency but not explicitly listed in deliverables.                                                                      | Verify that M1.5.4 exported a stable public API.                                      |
| 6 | **Confetti fallback** – opacity flash fallback behaviour not fully specified (duration, colour).                                                                                             | Add design note or reference to design tokens.                                        |

---

## 2. Non-Obvious Edge Cases

1. Reduced-motion setting toggled _after_ page load – overlay should update
   accordingly.
2. Multiple completions in quick succession → ensure one confetti instance at a
   time (debounce).
3. Offline mode – analytics events must queue and flush later without loss.
4. Screen-reader mode – verify semantics announcements during overlay display.
5. Dark theme & high-contrast theme – confetti colours and coach copy contrast.
6. Accessibility focus – ensure overlay does not trap focus or impede `Tab`
   navigation.

## 3. Mini QA Plan

| Layer  | Test Type               | Tool / File                             | Notes                                           |
| ------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Widget | Confetti overlay on/off | `confetti_overlay_test.dart`            | Verify visibility for both animation settings.  |
| Widget | Coach message variants  | `coach_message_variants_test.dart`      | Parametrize for success vs failure and locales. |
| Golden | Reduced-motion UI       | `daily_checkin_card_reduced_motion.png` | Baseline against master image.                  |
| Unit   | Analytics payload       | `action_step_analytics_test.dart`       | Mock Amplitude, assert full schema.             |
| A11y   | Automated audit         | `scripts/a11y/run_axe_action_steps.sh`  | Run on both iOS & Android emulators.            |
| Perf   | Frame timing            | `make perf-confetti` (NEW)              | Capture timeline, assert < 16 ms/frame p95.     |

## 4. Action Items (Pre-Implementation)

1. Publish detailed Amplitude event schema (see Missing Item #2).
2. Confirm `ActionStepCompletionController` public API and include in tech spec.
3. Extend T4 estimate or split audit / remediation tasks.
4. Add clarity on confetti fallback design (Missing Item #6).
5. Define performance measurement script and target devices.
6. Attach localization keys for new coach messages to arb files.

## Sign-off

The milestone is **ready to enter development** once the above action items are
acknowledged and tracked. No major blockers detected.
