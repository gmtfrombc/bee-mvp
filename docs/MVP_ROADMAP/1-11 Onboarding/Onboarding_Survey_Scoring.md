# Motivation Scoring â€“ Internal vs External (BEE Onboarding)

This document defines a scoring algorithm to classify a patient's current motivational state as **External**, **Internal**, or **Mixed**, based on their responses to onboarding survey questions 13, 14, and 16. Rooted in Self-Determination Theory.

## ðŸ§® Scoring Algorithm

```python
total_score = Q13 + Q14 + Q16

if total_score >= 5:
    motivation_type = "Primarily Internal"
elif 3 <= total_score < 5:
    motivation_type = "Mixed / Internalizing"
elif 1 <= total_score < 3:
    motivation_type = "Primarily External"
else:
    motivation_type = "External or Uncertain"
```

## ðŸ§  How AI Should Use This

| Score Range | Label | Implications for Coaching |
|-------------|-------|----------------------------|
| 6â€“7 | Internal | Empower, reflect, identity-based goals |
| 3â€“5 | Mixed / Internalizing | Highlight meaning, ask deeper questions |
| 1â€“2 | External | Focus on structure, support small wins |
| 0 | Unclear / Amotivated | Use curiosity, spark value discovery |
