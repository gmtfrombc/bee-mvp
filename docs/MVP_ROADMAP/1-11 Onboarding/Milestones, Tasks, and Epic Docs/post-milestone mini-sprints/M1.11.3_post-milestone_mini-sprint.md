## 📋 Task Breakdown

| ID | Description                                                                                                     | Owner | Est. hrs | Priority  | Dependencies |
| -- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------- | --------- | ------------ |
| R1 | Add automated performance test to verify Radio-choice latency <50 ms (use `flutter_test` & `benchmark_harness`) | TBD   | 2h       | 🟢 High   | –            |
| R2 | Create golden tests (phone & tablet, light & dark) for `ReadinessPage` & `MindsetPage`; store under `_goldens/` | TBD   | 4h       | 🟢 High   | R1           |
| R3 | Optional: implement `SemanticsSortKey` for future-proof focus ordering; update a11y documentation               | TBD   | 1h       | 🟡 Deferred | –            |

> **Total est. effort:** **7 h** (≈ 1 dev day)

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

1. Performance benchmark shows **p95 < 50 ms** on radio-choice selection.
2. Golden tests pass on both breakpoints & themes.
3. `flutter test` and `flutter analyze --fatal-warnings` return zero issues.
4. Accessibility audit updated, with no critical blockers.

---

## 🛠️ Dev Notes

- Re-use existing `Device` definitions from previous golden tests.
- Use `Profiler.startSync`/`stopSync` or `benchmark_harness` for latency
  measurement.
- Keep all magic numbers abstracted via `ResponsiveService` & `AppTheme` tokens.
