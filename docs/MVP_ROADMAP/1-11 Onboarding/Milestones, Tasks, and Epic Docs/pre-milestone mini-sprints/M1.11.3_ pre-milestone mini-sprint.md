# Pre-Milestone Mini-Sprint: Readiness & Mindset UI (M1.11.3)

**Parent Milestone:** M1.11.3 · UI – Sections 3–4 (Readiness & Mindset)\
**Epic:** 1.11 · Onboarding Intake Surveys\
**Status:** 🚧 _Proposed_\
**Priority:** Medium – Clarify minor gaps before coding starts

---

## 🎯 Sprint Goal

Resolve minor specification gaps (model fields, localization, performance metric
definition, a11y focus spec) so the milestone can begin with clear, testable
requirements.

---

## Resources Available

Onboarding questions for readiness/priorities (ReadinessPage) and Mindset and
Motivation (MindsetPage) are available in docs/MVP_ROADMAP/1-11
Onboarding/Onboarding_Survey.md. Scoring Algorithm available in:
docs/MVP_ROADMAP/1-11 Onboarding/Onboarding_Survey_Scoring.md

## 🛠️ Action Items

| ID     | Task                                                                                                            | Owner         | Est. Time | Status      |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| **A1** | Define `readiness_level` & `mindset_type` fields in `OnboardingDraft` model and update JSON serialization tests | State Lead    | 1 h       | ✅ Complete |
| **A2** | Add English placeholder strings for Q10–16 to ARB localization files; update `S` regeneration script            | i18n          | 0.5 h     | ✅ Complete |
| **A3** | Document keyboard focus order & expected semantics for `LikertSelector`; include in design system wiki          | UX / A11y     | 1 h       | ✅ Complete |
| **A4** | Specify measurement method for “radio-choice latency <50 ms” (e.g., integration test using `flutter_driver`)    | QA Lead       | 0.5 h     | ✅ Complete |
| **A5** | Create colour contrast tokens for `surfaceVariant` use-case and verify WCAG AA in Figma                         | Design System | 1 h       | ✅ Complete |

---

## 📦 Deliverables

1. Updated `onboarding_draft.dart` plus unit tests.
2. New/updated ARB entries & regenerated localization code.
3. Markdown doc detailing focus order spec under `docs/accessibility/`.
4. Test plan snippet describing latency measurement in `test/README.md`.
5. Colour token additions in design-system palette.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Model fields compile and pass all existing tests (`--fatal-warnings`).
- `flutter gen-l10n` runs without missing keys; widgets display localized text.
- `LikertSelector` keyboard tab order documented and peer-reviewed.
- Latency measurement approach agreed and documented.
- Contrast check passes automated scan (axe-flutter) on Figma-derived colours.

## ⏱ Suggested Timeline _(total ≈ 4 h)_

| Day       | Morning | Afternoon        |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| **Day 1** | A1, A2  | A3, A4           |
| **Day 2** | A5      | Buffer / reviews |

## 🔄 Post-Sprint Actions

1. Merge updates into milestone branch.
2. Re-run readiness audit – expect ✅ PASS.
