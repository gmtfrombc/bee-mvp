# Pre-Milestone Audit: M1.11.6 · Navigation & Completion Hook

## Summary Judgment

✅ **Proceed** – The milestone is sufficiently specified to begin
implementation, with a few clarifications best handled via a short mini-sprint.

---

## Missing / Ambiguous Items

1. **Supabase RPC contract** – Exact SQL for `submit_onboarding` (tables
   touched, expected payload, error codes, idempotency) is not provided.
2. **Offline queue persistence** – Where is the draft submission stored when the
   device is offline (Secure Storage vs. Hive box)? Retention policy?
3. **Rollback scope** – What isolation level / save-points are needed to
   guarantee all-or-nothing behaviour when multiple inserts happen?
4. **Performance metric definition** – "Home screen loads within 100 ms" needs
   clarification: measured from splash dismiss to first frame rendered on
   physical device or simulator?
5. **Guard interaction with deep links** – Behaviour if a deep link points past
   onboarding while `onboarding_complete = false`.
6. **Retry / idempotency** – How to detect and avoid duplicate submissions if
   the app retries after partial failure.

---

## Non-Obvious Edge Cases

- User completes onboarding on device A, then opens device B before sync occurs.
- App crashes midway through multi-insert RPC, local flag stays false.
- Network timeout after DB rows are inserted but before client receives 200 OK.
- User remains offline for > 7 days; local queue grows large.
- Schema migration runs while a submission is in flight (version mismatch).

---

## Mini QA Plan

1. **Unit Tests**
   - `onboarding_serializer.dart` full round-trip encode/decode.
   - `OnboardingGuard` state matrix (user × flag combinations).
2. **Integration Tests**
   - Call `submit_onboarding` against local Supabase emulator; assert rollback
     on forced error.
   - Offline queue ➜ go online ➜ auto-retry succeeds.
3. **E2E (Patrol / Flutter Driver)**
   - Registration → Onboarding → Home flow on Android & iOS.
   - Deep-link to /home when onboarding incomplete ➜ expect redirect.
4. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Measure splash→home frame time on physical mid-tier device (< 100 ms).

| ID | Task                                                                      | Owner   | Est. Time |
| -- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| C1 | Draft SQL for `submit_onboarding` RPC incl. transaction & error codes ✅  | Backend | 1 h       |
| C2 | Decide offline queue storage & retention strategy ✅                      | Mobile  | 0.5 h     |
| C3 | Define performance measurement method & tooling  ✅                       | QA      | 0.5 h     |
| C4 | Document idempotency / duplicate-submission guard ✅                      | Backend | 0.5 h     |
| C5 | Clarify deep-link behaviour with `OnboardingGuard` ✅                     | Mobile  | 0.5 h     |

_Total ≈ 3 h – fits inside proposed mini-sprint._
