## 📦 Deliverables

1. Updated, fully-specified DDL file(s) in `supabase/migrations/` (draft PR).
2. `.sqlfluff` config in project root; package added to
   `tests/requirements-minimal.txt`.
3. CI workflow step running `sqlfluff lint`.
4. Markdown note in this file (or milestone) clarifying performance metric.
5. README snippet detailing `shared_audit()` trigger usage.
6. Rollback test script `tests/db/test_migration_rollback.py`.
7. Updated `docker-compose.test.yml` (or equivalent) pinning Postgres version.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

- All tables & enum definitions are **complete** and reviewed.
- RLS policies deny cross-user access; positive/negative tests pass.
- `sqlfluff lint` returns **zero P0 violations** for existing migrations.
- CI defines and enforces the agreed-upon <10 s performance check.
- `shared_audit()` triggers attach cleanly; audit tests pass.
- Rollback script confirms schema parity pre-/post-migration.
