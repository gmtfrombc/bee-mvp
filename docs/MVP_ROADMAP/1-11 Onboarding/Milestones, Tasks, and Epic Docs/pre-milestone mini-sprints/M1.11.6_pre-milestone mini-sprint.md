# Pre-Milestone Mini-Sprint: Navigation & Completion Hook (M1.11.6)

**Parent Milestone:** M1.11.6 · Navigation & Completion Hook\
**Epic:** 1.11 · Onboarding Intake Surveys\
**Status:** 🚧 _Proposed_\
**Priority:** High – Close specification gaps before coding starts

---

## 🎯 Sprint Goal

Resolve outstanding specification gaps (RPC contract, offline queue design,
performance metric definition, guard/deep-link interaction) so the milestone can
begin with unambiguous, testable requirements.

---

## Resources Available

- Milestone spec: `M1.11.6_navigation-completion-hook.md`
- Existing survey models & guard logic in `app/lib/features/onboarding/`
- Supabase emulator & docs in `docs/supabase_emulator_setup.md`
