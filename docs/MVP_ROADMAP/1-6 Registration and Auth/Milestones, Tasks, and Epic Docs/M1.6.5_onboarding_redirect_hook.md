### M1.6.5 · Onboarding Redirect Hook

**Epic:** 1.6 Registration & Auth\

---

## Goal

Automatically route brand-new users into the onboarding flow and ensure they
skip it on subsequent logins.

## Success Criteria

- New accounts navigate to onboarding immediately after sign-up.
- Returning users with `profiles.onboarding_complete = true` bypass onboarding.
- Unit test proves routing logic for both cases.
- Flag set to `true` at the end of onboarding flow.

## Milestone Breakdown

| Task ID | Description                                      | Hours | Status       |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----- | ------------ |
| T1      | Query `profiles.onboarding_complete` after login | 1h    | ✅ Completed |
| T2      | Navigate to Onboarding flow (Epic 1.11) if false | 1h    | ✅ Completed |
| T3      | Update flag to true at end of onboarding         | 1h    | ✅ Completed |

## Milestone Deliverables

- Redirect middleware `onboarding_redirect.dart`.
- Supabase update helper in `auth_service.dart`.
- Unit + integration tests.
- Docs update in Epic 1.11 spec.

## Implementation Details

**File Paths**

- `lib/core/middleware/onboarding_redirect.dart`
- `lib/core/services/auth_service.dart` (update flag logic)

```dart
// lib/core/middleware/onboarding_redirect.dart
class OnboardingRedirect {
  OnboardingRedirect(this._router, this._service);
  final GoRouter _router;
  final AuthService _service;

  Future<void> maybeRedirect(User user) async {
    final profile = await _service.fetchProfile(user.id);
    if (profile.onboardingComplete == false) {
      _router.go('/onboarding');
    }
  }
}
```

### Flow

1. After login success, `AuthController` calls `redirect.maybeRedirect(user)`.
2. If `onboarding_complete` is `false`, navigate to `/onboarding`.
3. On final onboarding screen, call `authService.completeOnboarding()`, which
   updates the flag.
4. Next app launch, user lands on `HomePage`.

### Edge Cases

- Supabase query latency ➜ keep user on Splash until complete.
- Query error ➜ default to showing onboarding (safer).
- Flag update fails ➜ retry with exponential backoff.

### Testing Approach

- **Unit:** mock Supabase responses (flag true/false) and assert correct route.
- **Integration:** sign-up → onboarding, complete flow → relaunch app → home
  screen.
- Use `flutter_test` + `go_router_test` utilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Redirect occurs for new users.
- [x] Users who completed onboarding go straight to Home.
- [x] `profiles.onboarding_complete` is updated.
- [x] Tests pass in CI.

## Dependencies / Notes

- Depends on onboarding UI (Epic 1.11).
- Requires `profiles` table from M1.6.1.
- Uses `GoRouter` for navigation; ensure route `/onboarding` registered.
