Mini Sprint - Milestone M1.6.5 – Onboarding Redirect Hook

## ⏱ Status Flags

✅ Completed

---

## Summary

This mini-sprint sets up all prerequisite scaffolding required to implement
**Milestone M1.6.5 – Onboarding Redirect Hook**. It introduces profile-fetch
utilities, route redirection logic, and test harnesses so that the full
milestone can focus on UI polish rather than plumbing.

---

## Core Deliverables

1. `Profile` model (`lib/core/models/profile.dart`) mirroring `public.profiles`
   table.
2. Extended `AuthService` with `fetchProfile()` and `completeOnboarding()`
   helpers.
3. Riverpod providers exposing `Profile` and onboarding status.
4. Initial `go_router` setup with `/onboarding` and existing home routes.
5. `OnboardingRedirect` middleware in
   `lib/core/middleware/onboarding_redirect.dart`.
6. Splash/loading logic that awaits profile fetch before first page render.
7. Unit & integration test skeletons (≥ 70 % coverage for new code).

## Technical Specs

| Area               | Detail                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Database           | `public.profiles.onboarding_complete` boolean (already exists)                |
| Routing            | `go_router` v6; add `/onboarding` route                                       |
| Middleware Pattern | `OnboardingRedirect.maybeRedirect(User)` called after successful login        |
| Splash Logic       | Keep user on splash until profile fetched; default to onboarding on error     |
| Retry Strategy     | `completeOnboarding()` retries 2× with exponential backoff on network failure |
| Testing Utilities  | `go_router_test`, `mocktail`, and Supabase mock client                        |

## Supabase Emulator Considerations

No changes; continues to use `.env.test` sample and reset script from earlier
milestones.

### Completion Criteria

• All tasks above marked ✅ and merged to `main`. • CI passes with ≥ 85 % test
coverage on new code. • App launches with redirect logic functioning in emulator
and on device.

---

### Blockers / Open Questions

1. Confirm preferred Riverpod pattern (`Provider` vs `StateNotifier`) for
   onboarding flag exposure.
2. Decide on splash screen UX during slow network conditions (> 3 s).

### Completion Note

Upon finishing this mini-sprint, the project will be fully prepared to commence
**Milestone M1.6.5 – Onboarding Redirect Hook**, focusing on UI/UX and final
acceptance criteria.
