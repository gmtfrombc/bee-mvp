# M1.7.3 · Pre-Milestone Readiness Audit

## Summary Judgment

✅ **Proceed** – The milestone is largely complete and feasible to begin. Minor
clarifications (listed below) should be addressed in a short mini-sprint but are
not blocking.

## Missing / Ambiguous Items

| # | Observation                                                                                                    | Impact                                                         |
| - | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **Edge-function schedule of every 2 min** may exceed Supabase free-tier/paid quotas. Confirm plan vs. limits.  | May require longer interval or paginated processing.           |
| 2 | **7-day mean calculation** for new users (< 7 days of data) is undefined – clarify fallback logic.             | Could generate false positives or crash on division-by-zero.   |
| 3 | **`health_aggregates_daily` indexes** are assumed but not specified.                                           | Performance risk vs. 500 ms SLA.                               |
| 4 | **Real-time broadcast channel auth** not described.                                                            | App may not receive flag without proper RLS or anon key perms. |
| 5 | **Coach prompt template source of truth**: spec mentions both Dart and TS locations. Pick one canonical store. | Avoid duplicate maintenance.                                   |
| 6 | **Momentum score update listener** dependency on Epic 1.8 not explicitly gated.                                | Could block success criteria if Epic 1.8 slips.                |
| 7 | **Rollback / dedup strategy** if mis-flags are created then resolved.                                          | Data hygiene & user trust.                                     |

## Non-Obvious Edge Cases

1. Users with **zero sleep/step records** the previous day.
2. Users spanning **multiple time-zones** or DST transitions.
3. Rapid oscillation: step count dips below threshold on day 1, rebounds on day
   2, dips again on day 3 – ensure 24 h suppression logic works.
4. **Bulk backfill imports** should not trigger historical flags.
5. Deleted users / UID mismatch between `auth.users` and aggregates.

## Mini QA Plan

| Layer                | Tests                                                                                                             | Tools                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| SQL                  | pgTAP: table schema, RLS owner-only, ON DELETE CASCADE for `auth.users`                                           | pgTAP, supabase-cli db reset |
| Edge-Function (Deno) | Unit: threshold maths, 24 h idempotency, broadcast payload shape; Performance: < 500 ms with synthetic 10 k users | deno test, time benchmarking |
| Integration          | Supabase emulator + mocked Coach API; ensure flag row, broadcast, and prompt API call within < 30 s               | supabase-cli + msw           |
| Flutter Service      | Provider returns parsed flags list, handles real-time stream dropouts                                             | flutter_test, mocktail       |
| E2E (optional)       | Simulated wearable drop → flag → Coach message → Momentum score update                                            | IntegrationTest (Flutter)    |

Coverage target ≥ 90 % line & branch in each layer. Performance budgets:
Edge-function p99 < 500 ms; Coach prompt latency < 30 s.

| A4 | Specify broadcast channel & RLS perms for `biometric_flag` events.             | TBD   | ✅ Completed |
| A5 | Choose single source for prompt templates (Dart **or** TypeScript).            | TBD   | ⚪ Planned   |
| A6 | Align timeline with Epic 1.8 dependency for Momentum listener.                 | TBD   | ⚪ Planned   |
