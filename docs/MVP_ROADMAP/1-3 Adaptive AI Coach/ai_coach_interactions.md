## ✳️ AI Coaching Interactions and Update of Motivation Score

SUMMARY: All AI coach interactions are assessed and if sufficiently detailed are assigned a 'score' with regards to motivational status.

✅ User Initiated Chat
	•	When a patient completes a chat, the AI coach assesses word choice, tone, and simiilar characteristics to discern motivational state and degree of extrinsic <=> instrinisc motivation
	•	Chat completion can be based on the creation of a new chat, or an be timebased (e.g. no further messages within a given period of time--for example, 15 minutes)
    •	We'll have to determine approach for situations whereby the user 'comes back' to a chat after an extended period of time (or surfaces an old chat) 

✅ Coach Initiated Chat
	•	Coach will be reaching out to users periodically--for example, giving feedback on a completed workout, time to set an action step for the week etc.
	•	Periodically (consider weekly or biweekly) coach will ask 1-2 short questions to assess motivational state - external, introspective, internal etc. 
    •	Responses will be used to update patients 'Motivation_Score' which *may* be factored into 'Momentum_Score'

✅ Conversational Style
	•	Users will put off from overly clinical or generic questions. "How does that make you feel"
    •	Questions will be standardized and conversational
