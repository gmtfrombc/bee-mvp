## 🧪 **Testing Strategy & Schedule**

The BEE project follows a *green-baseline, incremental-growth* approach to testing:

1. **Green Baseline** – The current passing suite (~120 Flutter tests + Edge-Function unit tests) is considered the baseline.  CI fails on any PR that breaks `flutter analyze` or `flutter test`.
2. **Incremental Additions** – Whenever a new public method, widget, service, or Edge-Function endpoint is created *or* an existing one is refactored, the same PR must add **one** happy-path unit test *plus* critical edge-case tests.  This keeps coverage climbing where the code actually evolves.
3. **Milestone-Level Integration Tests** – For large epics we add focused integration/performance suites at the end of each milestone (see Phase-3 tasks M1.3.9-M1.3.10 for concrete test tasks).
4. **Coverage Targets** – Core business logic ≥ 85 %, UI snapshots ≤ 5 % of total LOC.  Measured in CI with `flutter test --coverage` and surfaced in the dashboard.
5. **Legacy Isolation** – Obsolete tests are archived under `archive/legacy_tests/` and excluded from analyzer to avoid noise while preserving historical context.

With this policy we achieve a continuously improving, yet lightweight, safety net without big-bang rewrites.

- External motivation indicators (goal completion rates, external triggers)
- Internal motivation indicators (unprompted engagement, habit formation)
- Transition milestone identification and patterns
- Personalized transition timeline predictions

### **4. Predictive Motivation Crisis Detection**

Advanced early warning system:

- Multi-factor motivation risk assessment
- Proactive intervention before motivation loss becomes critical
- Integration of physiological, behavioral, and linguistic indicators
