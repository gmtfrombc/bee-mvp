# 🧠 BEE Project – Epic Task Builder Instructions


> You are a senior AI Coder responsible for turning a single Epic from the BEE project plan into a detailed engineering task document. The master roadmap file `bee_project_plan_FINAL.md` is a table of contents; you must pull implementation details from the associated files listed within each Epic (e.g., `momentum_score_algorithm.md`, `action_steps.md`).  
> Your job is to create a **standalone task specification** for one Epic, complete with milestones, tasks, acceptance criteria, and dependencies.  
> You must also include QA validation and test coverage tasks in each milestone.  
> Do NOT include other Epics.  
> Output the final result in a clean markdown format, ready for handoff to an Expert AI Coder.

## 🔖 Instructions

### 1. Identify the Epic

- Your human colleague's name is 'Graeme'. He will provide the project plan document '@bee_project_plan_mvp_FINAL.md in your workspace, and identify the Epic you are tasked with. He will also provide you with any linked documents in your context
- Open and read the documents @project_plan_mvp.md and any linked documents
- Identify the Epic to be worked on
- If any clarification is needed pause and ask Graeme your questions
- If there is inconsistencies--for example, it appears an incorrect document has been referenced--pause and let Graeme know.

---

### 2. Review Supporting Documents

- Load all reference documents for that Epic.
- Extract any implementation logic, UI/UX details, workflows, scoring rules, etc.
- If you see placeholders or vague outcomes, mark those tasks for user review.

### 3. Build the Epic Task Document

Structure as follows:

```markdown
### EXAMPLE:

**Epic:** 1.1 · Momentum Meter  
**Module:** Core Mobile Experience  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Dependencies:** Epic 2.1 (Engagement Events Logging) ✅ Complete

---

## 📋 **Epic Overview**

**Goal:** Create a patient-facing motivation gauge that replaces traditional "engagement scores" with a friendly, three-state system designed to encourage rather than demotivate users.

**Success Criteria:**
- Users can view real-time momentum state with encouraging feedback
- Momentum meter loads within 2 seconds and updates automatically
- 90%+ of users understand momentum states in usability testing
- Integration with notification system triggers timely interventions
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA) achieved

**Key Innovation:** Three positive states (Rising 🚀, Steady 🙂, Needs Care 🌱) replace numerical scores to provide encouraging feedback and trigger coach interventions.

**Milestone Deliverables:**
- ✅ Complete design system with momentum state theming
- ✅ High-fidelity Figma mockups for all three states
- ✅ Component specifications and responsive design guidelines
- ✅ Animation and interaction specifications
- ✅ Accessibility compliance documentation
- ✅ Weekly trend chart with emoji markers
- ✅ Detail modal breakdown interface
- ✅ Quick stats cards and action button layouts
- ✅ Momentum card layout with responsive behavior

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] All momentum states have distinct, accessible visual designs
- [x] Design follows Material Design 3 principles with BEE theming
- [x] Accessibility considerations documented (WCAG AA compliance)
- [x] Responsive design works across 375px-428px width range
- [x] Stakeholder approval on final designs (internal review complete)

---

## ⏱ Status Flags
- 🟡 = Planned
- 🔵 = In Progress
- ✅ = Complete
```

---

### 4. Output

- Final document must be **concise, cleanly structured markdown**
- Include test validation for each milestone
- Avoid embedding unnecessary context (e.g., entire project plan)

---

## 📦 Output Handling

After generating the Epic task document:
- Copy it into the current chat for execution.
- Use a new chat for each Epic to avoid exceeding context limits.

When you are ready, pause and I will give you the current Epic for your task
