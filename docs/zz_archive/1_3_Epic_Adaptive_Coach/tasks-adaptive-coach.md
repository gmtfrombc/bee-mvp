   rework
3. **Development Efficiency**: Backend team can work on Epic 2.2/2.3 while
   frontend polishes Phase 1
4. **User Value**: Phase 1 delivers substantial coaching value allowing for user
   feedback
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Ensures complex wearable integration is stable before
   advanced features
6. **Promise Delivery**: Phase 1 already delivers core promise elements, Phase 3
   completes the vision
