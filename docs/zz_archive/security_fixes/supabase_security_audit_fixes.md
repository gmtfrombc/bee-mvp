# Supabase Security Audit Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities found in the Supabase
security audit and the fixes applied to resolve them.

## Security Issues Identified

### 1. **CRITICAL: Auth Users Exposed** (ERROR Level)

- **Issue**: The `coach_intervention_queue` view exposed `auth.users` data to
  anonymous roles
- **Risk**: Potential exposure of user email addresses and authentication data
- **Affected View**: `public.coach_intervention_queue`

### 2. **CRITICAL: Security Definer Views** (ERROR Level)

- **Issue**: 21+ views defined with `SECURITY DEFINER` property
- **Risk**: Views bypass Row Level Security (RLS) and use creator's permissions
  instead of querying user's permissions
- **Affected Views**:
  - `content_generation_monitoring`
  - `content_generation_metrics`
  - `momentum_dashboard`
  - `coach_intervention_queue`
  - `intervention_analytics`
  - `intervention_effectiveness_summary`
  - `wearable_live_metrics_aggregated`
  - `score_calculation_monitoring`
  - `notification_analytics`
  - `recent_user_momentum`
  - `intervention_candidates`
  - And 10+ more content/analytics views

### 3. **CRITICAL: RLS Disabled in Public Schema** (ERROR Level)

- **Issue**: 3 tables in public schema without Row Level Security enabled
- **Risk**: Data accessible to any authenticated user regardless of ownership
- **Affected Tables**:
  - `public.system_logs`
  - `public.realtime_event_metrics`
  - `public.momentum_error_logs`

## Fixes Applied

### Migration: `20250120000000_security_fixes.sql`

#### 1. Fixed Auth.Users Exposure

```sql
-- Removed direct auth.users JOIN from coach_intervention_queue view
-- Now uses user_id without exposing email to anon users
-- Added secure helper functions for coaches to access user emails when needed
```

#### 2. Enabled RLS on All Missing Tables

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.system_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.realtime_event_metrics ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
ALTER TABLE public.momentum_error_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

#### 3. Created Proper RLS Policies

- **System Logs**: Only service role can access
- **Realtime Metrics**: Users can see their own metrics only
- **Error Logs**: Users can see their own errors only

#### 4. Removed SECURITY DEFINER from Views

- Dropped all problematic views with `SECURITY DEFINER`
- Recreated essential views without `SECURITY DEFINER`
- Now rely on proper RLS policies for access control

#### 5. Added Secure Helper Functions

```sql
-- For coaches to securely access user emails
get_user_email_for_coach(UUID) 

-- For secure intervention details with user context  
get_intervention_with_user_context(UUID)
```

#### 6. Tightened Permissions

- Revoked all access to `auth` schema from `anon` and `authenticated` roles
- Revoked direct access to `auth.users` table
- Granted minimal necessary permissions on views

## Security Best Practices Applied

### Row Level Security (RLS)

- **Enabled on all user-facing tables**
- **Policies enforce user ownership**: Users can only see their own data
- **Service role bypass**: Administrative functions still work through service
  role

### Principle of Least Privilege

- **No direct auth.users access**: Helper functions control email access
- **Role-based permissions**: Coaches get additional permissions through role
  checks
- **View-specific grants**: Each view has minimal necessary permissions

### Defense in Depth

- **Multiple security layers**: RLS + View permissions + Helper functions
- **Secure function design**: Functions validate permissions before data access
- **Audit trail**: Security changes logged to system_logs

## Impact Assessment

### ‚úÖ Security Improvements

- **Zero auth.users exposure** to anonymous users
- **Complete RLS coverage** on all public tables
- **Eliminated privilege escalation** through SECURITY DEFINER views
- **Enhanced audit trail** for security events

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Breaking Changes

- **Views recreated**: Some analytics views were dropped and recreated
- **Function signatures**: New helper functions may require app updates
- **Permission changes**: More restrictive access may affect some queries

### üîÑ Required Updates

- **Update any queries** that relied on old view structures
- **Use helper functions** instead of direct auth.users access
- **Test coach permissions** to ensure proper email access
- **Verify analytics** still work with recreated views

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Anonymous users cannot access auth.users data
- [ ] Users can only see their own momentum data
- [ ] Coaches can access intervention details with user context
- [ ] System logs only accessible to service role
- [ ] All views return expected data with proper filtering
- [ ] Mobile app still functions correctly
- [ ] Admin dashboard works with new view structures

## Monitoring

Monitor these metrics post-deployment:

- **403/401 errors**: May indicate permission issues
- **View query performance**: Recreated views may have different performance
- **Coach functionality**: Ensure intervention management still works
- **User data leakage**: Verify no unauthorized data access

## Compliance

These fixes help ensure:

- **HIPAA compliance**: Proper data access controls
- **SOC 2 compliance**: Role-based access and audit trails
- **Security best practices**: Defense in depth, least privilege
- **Data privacy**: User data properly isolated

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy migration** to staging environment first
2. **Run comprehensive tests** on all affected functionality
3. **Update application code** if needed for new helper functions
4. **Deploy to production** during maintenance window
5. **Monitor for issues** and have rollback plan ready
