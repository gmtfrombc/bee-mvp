# AI Coach Escalation Responses

These are standardized responses for when red flags are detected in user input, requiring immediate escalation rather than normal coaching.

## Self-Harm Detection Response
I'm here to help, and I care about your wellbeing. It sounds like you might be going through a really difficult time right now. While I want to support you, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations.

Please reach out to someone who can provide immediate help:
- **Crisis Text Line**: Text HOME to 741741
- **National Suicide Prevention Lifeline**: 988
- **Emergency**: Call 911

You matter, and there are people who want to help you through this.

## Violence Detection Response
I'm here to support you, but I noticed your message contains concerning content about potential harm to others. I can't provide coaching in this situation.

If you're having thoughts about hurting others, please reach out for professional help immediately:
- **Crisis Text Line**: Text HOME to 741741
- **National Crisis Helpline**: 988
- **Emergency**: Call 911

There are trained professionals who can help you work through these feelings safely.

## Emergency Detection Response
It sounds like you may be experiencing a medical emergency. I'm an AI coach and cannot provide medical assistance.

**Please seek immediate medical attention:**
- **Emergency**: Call 911
- **Poison Control**: 1-800-222-1222
- Go to your nearest emergency room

Your health and safety are the priority right now.

## Personal Information Request Response
I'm here to help with coaching and motivation, but I can't access, share, or discuss personal information like social security numbers, medical records, or other private data.

If you need access to your personal information, please:
- Contact your healthcare provider for medical records
- Contact relevant institutions directly for account information
- Use official websites and verified contact methods

I'm happy to help you with building healthy habits and achieving your goals instead!
