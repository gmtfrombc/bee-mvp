- Standard Widgets: ‚â§300 lines (interactive components)  
- Complex Widgets: ‚â§500 lines (with justification)
- Screens: ‚â§400 lines
- Modals: ‚â§250 lines

**Complex Widget Criteria (2+ factors apply):**
- Multiple animation controllers (3+ animations)
- Custom painting/rendering logic
- Multiple UI states (loading/error/success)
- Complex responsive design logic
- Accessibility integrations
- Performance optimizations

## AI-Assisted Development Guidelines

### **ü§ñ For AI Assistants: Component Size Decision Tree**

When encountering components that exceed guidelines, follow this decision tree:

#### **Step 1: Assess Violation Severity**
```
‚â§110% of limit (e.g., 330 lines for standard widget):
  ‚Üí SOFT VIOLATION: Document and monitor, refactor only if clear improvement
  
111-150% of limit (e.g., 331-450 lines):
  ‚Üí MEDIUM VIOLATION: Evaluate complexity factors before refactoring
  
>150% of limit (e.g., >450 lines):
  ‚Üí HARD VIOLATION: Refactoring required
```

#### **Step 2: Complexity Factor Analysis**
For components 300+ lines, evaluate complexity factors:
```
0-1 complexity factors: ‚Üí REFACTOR (likely over-sized simple component)
2+ complexity factors: ‚Üí DOCUMENT as complex widget (up to 500 lines OK)
3+ complexity factors: ‚Üí APPROVE as justified complex widget
```

#### **Step 3: Refactoring Decision Matrix**

**üü¢ PROCEED with refactoring if:**
- Clear separation of concerns visible
- Natural component boundaries exist
- Repeated patterns can be extracted
- Business logic mixed with UI logic
- Multiple unrelated responsibilities

**üü° DOCUMENT & MONITOR if:**
- Component is cohesive but slightly over limit
- No clear extraction boundaries
- Complexity factors justify size
- Refactoring would create tight coupling

**üî¥ DO NOT refactor if:**
- Would create artificial splits
- No logical component boundaries
- Extraction would increase overall complexity
- Component is cohesive and serves single purpose

### **üß† AI Decision Examples**

#### **Example 1: Soft Violation - Document & Monitor**
```dart
class MomentumGauge extends StatefulWidget {  // 330 lines (110% of 300)
  // Complexity factors:
  // - 4 animation controllers ‚úì
  // - Custom painting ‚úì
  // - Responsive design ‚úì
  // = 3+ factors = APPROVE & DOCUMENT
  
  // AI Action: Add complexity documentation, do NOT refactor
}
```

#### **Example 2: Clear Refactoring Opportunity**
```dart
class UserDashboard extends StatelessWidget {  // 450 lines (150% of 300)
  // Contains:
  // - User profile display (100 lines)
  // - Notification list (150 lines)  
  // - Settings panel (100 lines)
  // - Analytics widgets (100 lines)
  // = 0 complexity factors, multiple responsibilities
  
  // AI Action: Extract 4 separate components
}
```

#### **Example 3: Cohesive Component - Do Not Split**
```dart
class ComplexFormWidget extends StatefulWidget {  // 380 lines (127% of 300)
  // Single responsibility: User registration form
  // Cohesive validation logic throughout
  // No clear separation boundaries
  // High coupling between form sections
  
  // AI Action: Document as justified complex widget
  // DO NOT artificially split - would create tight coupling
}
```

### **üö® AI Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

1. **Arbitrary Line Splitting**: Never split components just to hit line counts
2. **Premature Extraction**: Don't extract components that aren't naturally reusable
3. **Creating Tight Coupling**: Avoid splits that require props drilling or shared state
4. **Over-Abstraction**: Don't create unnecessary intermediate components

### **‚úÖ AI Best Practices**

1. **Evaluate Before Acting**: Always assess complexity factors first
2. **Prefer Documentation**: For borderline cases, document rather than refactor
3. **Seek Natural Boundaries**: Only extract at logical component seams
4. **Preserve Cohesion**: Maintain single responsibility principle
5. **Consider Maintainability**: Is the refactored code easier to understand?

### **üîß AI Refactoring Checklist**

Before refactoring an oversized component:
- [ ] **Severity Assessment**: Is this a hard violation (>150% limit)?
- [ ] **Complexity Analysis**: Are there <2 complexity factors?
- [ ] **Natural Boundaries**: Can I identify logical separation points?
- [ ] **Cohesion Check**: Will split components remain cohesive?
- [ ] **Coupling Analysis**: Will extraction create tight coupling?
- [ ] **Reusability Assessment**: Are extracted components genuinely reusable?
- [ ] **Maintainability**: Is the result easier to understand and maintain?

**If ANY of these fail, consider documentation over refactoring.**

## Pre-Review Checklist (Author)

### Widget Complexity Assessment
- [ ] **Complex widget criteria evaluation** (for widgets >300 lines)
  ```dart
  // ‚úÖ Justified complexity factors:
  class ComplexAnimatedWidget extends StatefulWidget {
    // Multiple animation controllers ‚úì
    // Custom painting logic ‚úì  
    // Responsive design ‚úì
    // Accessibility features ‚úì
    // = 4 complexity factors = Justified at 450 lines
  }
  
  // ‚ùå Unjustified size - needs refactoring:
  class BasicListWidget extends StatelessWidget {
    // Simple list rendering only
    // No animations, custom painting, or complex logic
    // = 0 complexity factors = Should be ‚â§200 lines
  }
  ```

### Single Responsibility Principle
- [ ] **Each component has one clear purpose**
  ```dart
  // ‚úÖ Good: Single responsibility
  class UserAvatarWidget extends StatelessWidget {
    // Only handles user avatar display
  }
  
  // ‚ùå Avoid: Multiple responsibilities
  class UserDashboardWidget extends StatelessWidget {
    // Handles avatar, notifications, settings, etc.
  }
  ```

### Separation of Concerns
- [ ] **UI components contain only presentation logic**
- [ ] **Business logic delegated to services**
- [ ] **Data access isolated in repository/service layer**
- [ ] **State management properly separated**

### Component Composition
- [ ] **Complex widgets built from smaller components**
- [ ] **Reusable components identified and extracted**
- [ ] **Clear component hierarchies**

## Code Quality Review

  // ‚úÖ Correct - Responsive service
  padding: ResponsiveService.getResponsivePadding(context)
  ```
- [ ] **Device-specific logic properly handled**
- [ ] **Consistent spacing using responsive utilities**

## State Management Review

### Provider/Riverpod Usage
- [ ] **Providers focused on single concerns**
- [ ] **Proper provider lifecycle management**

- [ ] **State kept as close to usage as possible**

```dart
// ‚úÖ Good: Focused provider
final userProfileProvider = StateNotifierProvider<UserProfileNotifier, UserProfile>(
  (ref) => UserProfileNotifier(ref.read(userServiceProvider)),
);

// ‚ùå Avoid: God provider
final appStateProvider = StateNotifierProvider<AppStateNotifier, AppState>(
  // Manages everything: users, notifications, settings, etc.
);
```

```dart
// ‚úÖ Good: Focused test
testWidgets('UserAvatarWidget displays initials when no image', (tester) async {
  // Arrange
  const user = User(name: 'John Doe');
  
  // Act
  await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp(
    home: UserAvatarWidget(user: user),
  ));
  
  // Assert
  expect(find.text('JD'), findsOneWidget);
});

## Common Review Patterns

### Anti-Pattern Detection

**God Components:**
```dart
// ‚ùå Red flag: Too many responsibilities
class UserDashboardScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  // Handles user profile, notifications, settings, analytics, etc.
  // 800+ lines of mixed concerns
}
```

**Unjustified Complexity:**
```dart
// ‚ùå Red flag: Large widget without complexity justification
class SimpleTextWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  // 400+ lines but only displays text
  // No animations, responsive logic, or complex state
}
```

**Tight Coupling:**
```dart
// ‚ùå Red flag: Direct service instantiation
class UserWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final service = UserService(); // Direct coupling
    // ...
  }
}
```

**Mixed Concerns:**
```dart
// ‚ùå Red flag: API calls in widgets
class DataWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder(
      future: http.get(apiUrl), // Business logic in UI
      // ...
    );
  }
}
```

### Good Pattern Recognition

**Justified Complex Widget:**
```dart
// ‚úÖ Good: Complex widget with clear justification
class MomentumGauge extends StatefulWidget {
  // Complexity factors:
  // - Multiple animation controllers (4 animations)
  // - Custom painting for gauge rendering
  // - Multi-state transitions (Rising/Steady/Care)
  // - Responsive sizing logic
  // - Accessibility integration (haptic feedback, screen reader)
  // - Performance optimizations (reduced motion, disposal)
  // Total: 530 lines with 6 complexity factors = JUSTIFIED
}
```

**Composition:**
```dart
// ‚úÖ Good: Clear composition
class UserProfileScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        UserProfileHeader(),
        UserProfileForm(),
        UserProfileActions(),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

**Dependency Injection:**
```dart
// ‚úÖ Good: Proper dependency injection
class UserProfileCard extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final user = ref.watch(userProvider);
    return UserProfileCardUI(user: user);
  }
}
```

## Review Comments Templates

### Component Size Violations

**Simple Widget Violation:**
```markdown
**Component Size Violation - Simple Widget**

This widget exceeds guidelines for simple components:
- Current: XXX lines
- Simple widget limit: 200 lines (XX% over)
- Standard widget limit: 300 lines (XX% over)

This widget appears to have minimal complexity. Consider:
1. Extracting helper widgets for repeated patterns
2. Moving business logic to services
3. Simplifying the component structure

If this widget has hidden complexity, please document the complexity factors.
```

**Unjustified Complex Widget:**
```markdown
**Component Size Violation - Insufficient Complexity Justification**

This widget exceeds the 300-line standard limit but lacks complexity justification:
- Current: XXX lines
- Complex widget limit: 500 lines
- **Missing complexity documentation**

For widgets >300 lines, please document 2+ complexity factors:
- [ ] Multiple animation controllers (3+ animations)
- [ ] Custom painting/rendering logic  
- [ ] Multiple UI states (loading/error/success)
- [ ] Complex responsive design logic
- [ ] Accessibility integrations
- [ ] Performance optimizations

If insufficient complexity factors exist, please refactor to ‚â§300 lines.

See: docs/development/refactoring_guide.md
```

**Justified Complex Widget:**
```markdown
**Component Size - Complex Widget Approved**

This widget exceeds 300 lines but demonstrates sufficient complexity:
- Current: XXX lines
- Complexity factors: [list factors]
- Status: ‚úÖ **APPROVED** for complex widget classification

Consider monitoring for future extraction opportunities while maintaining the justified complexity.
```

### Architecture Concerns

```markdown
**Architecture Concern: Mixed Responsibilities**

This component appears to handle multiple concerns:
- UI rendering
- Business logic
- Data fetching

Consider:
- Moving business logic to a service
- Using state management for data
- Keeping this component focused on UI

See: docs/architecture/component_guidelines.md
```

### Performance Issues

```markdown
**Performance Concern**

Expensive operation in build method:
```dart
// Line XX
final result = expensiveCalculation();
```

Consider:
- Moving to initState() or provider
- Caching the result
- Using useMemoized if using Hooks

See: docs/architecture/component_guidelines.md#performance-guidelines
```

### Responsive Design Issues

```markdown
**Responsive Design Violation**

Hardcoded values detected:
```dart
// Line XX
padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0)  // Should use ResponsiveService
```

Please use ResponsiveService for all spacing and sizing:
```dart
padding: ResponsiveService.getResponsivePadding(context)
```

See: Technical Considerations in refactor plan
```
