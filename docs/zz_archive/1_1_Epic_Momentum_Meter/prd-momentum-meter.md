# Product Requirements Document: Momentum Meter

**Epic:** 1.1 ¬∑ Core Mobile Experience  
**Feature:** Momentum Meter  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** üìù Draft  
**Created:** December 2024  
**Owner:** Product Team  

---

## üìã Executive Summary

The Momentum Meter is a patient-facing motivation gauge that replaces traditional "engagement scores" with a friendly, three-state system designed to encourage rather than demotivate users. It provides real-time feedback on user engagement through positive states‚ÄîRising üöÄ, Steady üôÇ, Needs Care üå±‚Äîand serves as the foundation for AI-driven nudges and coach interventions.

### **Key Benefits**
- **Patient-Friendly:** Eliminates demotivating numerical scores
- **Actionable:** Triggers timely interventions and support
- **Motivational:** Uses positive language and growth metaphors
- **Intelligent:** Enables AI and coach-driven personalization

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

Current engagement tracking systems often use numerical scores (0-100) that can be demotivating when low, creating anxiety and potential app abandonment. Users need encouraging feedback that motivates continued engagement without judgment.

### **User Pain Points**
- Numerical scores feel clinical and judgmental
- Low scores create shame and avoidance behaviors
- No clear guidance on how to improve
- Lack of positive reinforcement for small wins

---

## üéØ Product Goals

### **Primary Goals**
1. **Increase User Retention:** Reduce app abandonment due to demotivating feedback
2. **Enable Timely Interventions:** Trigger coach outreach when users need support
3. **Improve User Experience:** Provide encouraging, actionable feedback
4. **Support Behavior Change:** Motivate consistent engagement through positive reinforcement

### **Success Metrics**
| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| User comprehension of momentum states | 90% | User testing surveys |
| Daily momentum meter interaction rate | 70% | App analytics |
| User retention (7-day) | 85% | Cohort analysis |
| Time to load momentum meter | <2 seconds | Performance monitoring |
| Coach intervention effectiveness | 60% response rate | Clinical metrics |

## üîß Momentum Calculation Algorithm

### **Scoring Logic**
```python
def calculate_momentum_score(user_id, date):
    """
    Calculate momentum score using weighted engagement events
    with exponential decay and noise reduction.
    """
    
    # Data inputs with weights
    events = get_engagement_events(user_id, date, lookback_days=30)
    
    weights = {
        'app_open': 1.0,
        'lesson_complete': 3.0,
        'journal_entry': 2.0,
        'goal_complete': 2.5,
        'coach_message_read': 1.5,
        'coach_message_reply': 2.0,
        'telehealth_attend': 5.0,
        'telehealth_noshow': -3.0
    }
    
    # Apply exponential decay (10-day half-life)
    decay_factor = 0.5 ** (days_ago / 10)
    
    # Calculate weighted score
    total_score = 0
    for event in events:
        weight = weights.get(event.type, 1.0)
        decayed_weight = weight * decay_factor
        total_score += decayed_weight
    
    # Apply sigmoid normalization
    normalized_score = sigmoid(total_score) * 100
    
    # Three-day rolling average for noise reduction
    recent_scores = get_recent_scores(user_id, days=3)
    smoothed_score = np.mean(recent_scores + [normalized_score])
    
    return smoothed_score

def classify_momentum_zone(score):
    """Classify score into momentum zones."""
    if score >= 70:
        return "Rising"
    elif score >= 45:
        return "Steady"
    else:
        return "NeedsCare"
```

### **Intervention Rules**
```python
def check_intervention_triggers(user_id):
    """Check if user needs intervention based on momentum trends."""
    
    recent_scores = get_recent_scores(user_id, days=5)
    current_zone = get_current_zone(user_id)
    
    # Score drop trigger
    if len(recent_scores) >= 2:
        score_drop = recent_scores[0] - recent_scores[-1]
        if score_drop >= 15:
            send_supportive_notification(user_id)
    
    # Consecutive "Needs Care" trigger
    recent_zones = get_recent_zones(user_id, days=2)
    if all(zone == "NeedsCare" for zone in recent_zones):
        schedule_coach_call(user_id)
    
    # Celebration trigger
    recent_zones = get_recent_zones(user_id, days=5)
    if all(zone in ["Rising", "Steady"] for zone in recent_zones):
        send_celebration_message(user_id)
```
