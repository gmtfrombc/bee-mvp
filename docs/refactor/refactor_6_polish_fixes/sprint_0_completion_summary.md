## **🎯 Updated Sprint Plan**

Based on Sprint 0 analysis, the refactoring plan has been optimized:

### **Original Plan vs. Revised Plan**

| Sprint | Original Focus | Revised Focus | Reasoning |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Sprint 1** | TodayFeedTile Critical | ✅ **Same** | Still critical (1,261 lines) |
| **Sprint 2** | Large Widget Refactor | **CoachDashboardScreen** | Focus on remaining critical component |
| **Sprint 3** | Size Normalization | **RichContentRenderer** | High-impact, manageable extraction |
| **Sprint 4** | UX Polish | **MomentumGauge + Polish** | Complete remaining + UX enhancements |
| **Sprint 5** | Testing | ✅ **Same** | Comprehensive validation |

### **Estimated Time Savings**
- **Original Estimate:** 20-28 hours
- **Revised Estimate:** 12-16 hours (40% reduction)
- **Reason:** 8 components already refactored successfully
