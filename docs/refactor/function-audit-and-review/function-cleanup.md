# Function Cleanup Guide

> **Systematic approach to safely removing backend functions identified for deletion during the audit process.**

---

## 📋 **Overview**

This document provides detailed cleanup procedures for each backend function marked for deletion during the audit process. Each cleanup sprint includes dependency analysis, reference removal, infrastructure cleanup, and verification steps to ensure safe removal without breaking the codebase.

**Cleanup Philosophy**: 
- **Never delete function directories directly** - always clean up references first
- **Infrastructure first** - remove cloud resources before code
- **Archive before delete** - move function directories to archive folder for safety
- **Test everything** - verify no regressions after each step
- **Documentation last** - update docs after successful cleanup

### **Archive Folder Strategy**
- **Create archive directory**: `archive/functions/` (add to `.gitignore`)
- **Move, don't delete**: Move function directories to archive after cleanup completion
- **Safety period**: Keep archived functions for 30 days before permanent deletion
- **Git exclusion**: Ensure archive folder is completely excluded from version control

---

## ⚠️ **Common Cleanup Pitfalls**

### **Infrastructure Pitfalls**
- **Don't** delete function directories before removing cloud infrastructure
- **Don't** forget to update Terraform state after manual resource deletion
- **Don't** permanently delete function directories - use archive folder for safety
- **Do** verify cloud resources are actually removed (avoid surprise billing)
- **Do** check for dependent resources (IAM bindings, service accounts, etc.)
- **Do** keep archived functions for at least 30 days before permanent deletion

### **Code Reference Pitfalls**
- **Don't** remove constants that might be used in unreachable code paths
- **Don't** forget to search case-insensitive for function references
- **Do** check both direct imports and string references
- **Do** verify mobile app builds successfully after config changes

### **Testing Pitfalls**
- **Don't** skip verification testing after cleanup
- **Don't** assume unused functions can be safely removed without testing
- **Do** test in development environment first
- **Do** verify related functionality still works (e.g., real-time updates)

## 🔧 **Cleanup Tools and Scripts**

### **Reference Search Commands**
```bash
# Find all references to a function name
grep -r "function-name" . --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=node_modules

# Find config constant usage
grep -r "FunctionNameConstant" . --include="*.dart" --include="*.ts"

# Check for HTTP endpoint calls
grep -r "/functions/v1/function-name" . --include="*.dart" --include="*.ts"
```

### **Infrastructure Check Commands**
```bash
# Check Terraform state for resources
terraform state list | grep function-name

# Check GCP resources
gcloud run services list | grep function-name
gcloud scheduler jobs list | grep function-name
```

### **Verification Commands**
```bash
# Flutter app verification
cd app && flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter build apk --debug

# Test suite verification  
cd app && flutter test

# Final reference check
grep -r "deleted-function-name" . --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=archive

# Verify archive setup
ls -la archive/functions/
cat archive/README.md
```

## 📁 **Archive Management**

### **Archive Folder Structure**
```
archive/
├── functions/
│   ├── today-feed-generator-20241201/
│   ├── realtime-momentum-sync-20241201/
│   ├── momentum-intervention-engine-20241201/
│   └── [function-name]-[YYYYMMDD]/
└── README.md  # Archive log with deletion dates
```

### **Archive Lifecycle**
1. **Immediate Archiving**: Move function directory after successful cleanup
2. **Safety Period**: Keep archived functions for 30 days minimum  
3. **Documentation**: Log archive date and planned deletion date
4. **Permanent Deletion**: Remove from archive after safety period expires

### **Archive Setup Commands**
```bash
# Initial archive setup
mkdir -p archive/functions
echo "archive/" >> .gitignore

# Create archive README
cat > archive/README.md << 'EOF'
# Archived Functions Log

Functions moved to archive during cleanup process.
Keep for 30 days minimum before permanent deletion.

## Archive Log
- today-feed-generator: Archived 2025-06-01, Delete after 2025-07-01
- realtime-momentum-sync: Archived 2025-06-01, Delete after 2025-07-01
- momentum-intervention-engine: Archived 2025-06-01, Delete after 2025-07-01

EOF
```

### **Safety Benefits**
- **Recovery Option**: Quick restoration if issues discovered post-cleanup
- **Reference Preservation**: Code available for comparison or debugging
- **Gradual Cleanup**: Staged approach reduces risk of permanent data loss
- **Audit Trail**: Clear record of what was removed and when
