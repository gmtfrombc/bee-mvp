## 🚨 **Risks & Mitigation Strategies**

### **High Priority Risks**
1. **AI Response Quality**: Generated coaching may not be helpful or appropriate
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive prompt engineering and response validation

2. **API Cost Management**: AI API usage may exceed budget projections with enhanced features
   - *Mitigation*: Response caching, rate limiting, and cost monitoring

3. **Healthcare Compliance**: AI coaching may cross into medical advice territory
   - *Mitigation*: Clear safety boundaries and compliance review

4. **Emotional Detection Accuracy**: Emotional intelligence may misinterpret user states
   - *Mitigation*: User feedback loops and continuous model refinement

5. **Wearable Integration Complexity**: Real-time physiological data may be unreliable
   - *Mitigation*: Robust error handling and fallback systems

6. **Promise Delivery Gap**: System may not effectively support motivation transition
   - *Mitigation*: Explicit motivation tracking, user testing, and iterative improvement

### **Medium Priority Risks**
1. **User Acceptance**: Users may not find AI coaching valuable
   - *Mitigation*: User testing and iterative improvement based on feedback

2. **Performance Issues**: Enhanced features may impact response times
   - *Mitigation*: Performance optimization and intelligent caching

3. **Integration Complexity**: Complex integration with momentum, Today Feed, Enhanced Epic 2.2, and future Epic 4.4
   - *Mitigation*: Phased rollout and extensive integration testing

4. **Gamification Balance**: Reward systems may become overwhelming or ineffective
   - *Mitigation*: User research and adaptive gamification elements

5. **Cross-Epic Dependencies**: Enhanced epics may not deliver on schedule
   - *Mitigation*: Flexible architecture and graceful degradation
