## Key Fixes Applied

1. Wrapped **DailyCheckinCard** in `FocusTraversalGroup` and added explicit
   semantic labels for action buttons.
2. Added `Semantics` wrapper to the confetti fallback so screen-reader users
   receive a non-visual celebration cue.
3. No colour-contrast adjustments required after re-testing; existing tokens
   passed ≥ 4.5 : 1 ratio.

## Deferred Items

• Spoken announcement via `SemanticsService.announce`. • Golden test for
high-contrast theme variant.

These items are tracked in a follow-up ticket (1.5–Deferred-A11y-Enhancements).
