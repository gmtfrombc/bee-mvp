# Readiness & Mindset Pages – Accessibility Audit

Date: {{DATE}}

## Overview

VoiceOver (macOS) and TalkBack (Android) manual audits, complemented with
automated guideline tests, confirm that the Readiness and Mindset onboarding
pages satisfy baseline WCAG 2.1 AA criteria for contrast, focus order, and
semantic labelling.

## Manual Screen-Reader Findings

| Element                    | Expected Speech                             | Result     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Likert selector            | "Question prompt. Rating 3 of 5. Selected." | ✅ Correct |
| Priority chips             | "Priority Nutrition. Selected, button"      | ✅ Correct |
| Radio options              | Provided label + state                      | ✅ Correct |
| Continue button (disabled) | "Continue. Dimmed"                          | ✅ Correct |

No critical issues noted.

## Automated Guideline Tests

All tests pass (`labeledTapTargetGuideline`, `androidTapTargetGuideline`,
`textContrastGuideline`) for both pages.

## Recommendations / Next Steps

1. Re-test after any visual design changes.
2. Include `SemanticsSortKey` for fine-grained focus order if additional
   elements are added.
