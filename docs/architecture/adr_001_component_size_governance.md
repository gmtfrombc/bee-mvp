# ADR-001: Component Size Governance System

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-05-30  
**Deciders:** BEE Development Team  
**Technical Story:** Component Size Audit & Refactor Project - Sprint 5

## Context and Problem Statement

The BEE application codebase had grown to include multiple oversized components that violated established architectural principles and negatively impacted maintainability, testing, and developer productivity.

**Business Context:**
- Developer onboarding time increased due to complex, monolithic components
- Bug fix and feature development cycles slowed due to difficulty understanding large components
- Code review efficiency decreased with components exceeding reasonable comprehension limits
- Technical debt accumulated as developers avoided refactoring oversized components

**Technical Context:**
- Critical components exceeded 1,000+ lines (TodayFeedTile: 1,261 lines)
- Services contained mixed responsibilities (TodayFeedCacheStatisticsService: 981 lines)
- Screen components handled multiple concerns (CoachDashboardScreen: 946 lines)
- No automated enforcement of size guidelines existed
- Refactoring was reactive rather than proactive

## Decision Drivers

- **Developer Productivity:** Need to reduce cognitive load and improve code comprehension
- **Code Quality:** Maintain single responsibility principle and clear separation of concerns
- **Maintainability:** Enable easier testing, debugging, and feature addition
- **Team Scalability:** Support efficient onboarding and knowledge transfer
- **Technical Debt Prevention:** Proactively prevent accumulation of oversized components
- **Automation:** Reduce manual oversight burden through automated governance

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Manual Code Review Guidelines Only

**Description:** Establish size guidelines with manual enforcement during code reviews

**Pros:**
- Low implementation effort
- Flexible enforcement based on context
- No infrastructure changes required

**Cons:**
- Inconsistent enforcement
- Human error and oversight
- Reactive rather than proactive
- Scaling issues with team growth

**Implementation Effort:** Low  
**Risk Level:** High (inconsistent enforcement)

### Option 2: Automated Size Monitoring with Warnings

**Description:** Implement automated size checking with warnings but no build blocking

**Pros:**
- Raises awareness of violations
- Provides metrics and tracking
- Non-disruptive to development flow

**Cons:**
- Violations can still be committed
- May be ignored under pressure
- Gradual accumulation of violations

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
**Risk Level:** Medium (potential for accumulating violations)

### Option 3: Comprehensive Automated Governance System

**Description:** Full automated system with pre-commit hooks, CI/CD integration, and build blocking

**Pros:**
- Prevents violations from entering codebase
- Consistent enforcement across all developers
- Provides detailed reporting and metrics
- Proactive prevention of technical debt
- Supports team scaling

**Cons:**
- Higher implementation effort
- May initially slow development during adjustment period
- Requires team training and process changes
- Potential for friction in emergency situations

**Implementation Effort:** High  
**Risk Level:** Low (comprehensive enforcement)

### Option 4: Gradual Implementation with Existing Code Exemptions

**Description:** Implement governance for new code only, grandfather existing violations

**Pros:**
- Lower initial friction
- Gradual adoption
- Immediate prevention of new violations

**Cons:**
- Existing technical debt remains
- Inconsistent codebase standards
- May encourage workarounds

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
**Risk Level:** Medium (partial coverage)

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Option 3 - Comprehensive Automated Governance System

**Justification:** 
- Provides complete prevention of size violations
- Supports long-term code quality goals
- Enables team scaling with consistent standards
- Previous successful refactoring (OfflineCacheService) proved feasibility
- Team capacity available for implementation and training

### Positive Consequences

- **Complete Prevention:** No oversized components can enter the codebase
- **Consistent Enforcement:** Same standards applied to all developers
- **Proactive Management:** Issues caught before they become technical debt
- **Metrics and Reporting:** Clear visibility into component size compliance
- **Developer Experience:** Clearer guidelines and immediate feedback
- **Team Scalability:** New team members get immediate guidance

### Negative Consequences

- **Initial Learning Curve:** Team needs to adapt to new constraints
- **Emergency Bypass Complexity:** Critical fixes may require additional steps
- **Potential Development Friction:** May initially slow feature development
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Governance system requires ongoing maintenance

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
**Timeline:** 1-2 hours  
**Effort:** 8 person-hours  
**Dependencies:** None

- [x] Update analysis_options.yaml with component size documentation
- [x] Create pre-commit hooks for size checking
- [x] Implement manual size checking script
- [x] Make scripts executable and test functionality

### Phase 2: CI/CD Integration
**Timeline:** 2-3 hours  
**Effort:** 12 person-hours  
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 complete

- [x] Integrate size checking into GitHub Actions workflow
- [x] Implement PR comment generation with size reports
- [x] Add build failure conditions for size violations
- [x] Set up artifact generation for detailed reporting

### Phase 3: Reporting and Monitoring
**Timeline:** 2-3 hours  
**Effort:** 10 person-hours  
**Dependencies:** Phase 2 complete

- [x] Create weekly audit reporting script
- [x] Implement comprehensive compliance reporting
- [x] Set up historical tracking capabilities
- [x] Create monitoring dashboards and alerts

### Phase 4: Documentation and Training
**Timeline:** 1-2 hours  
**Effort:** 6 person-hours  
**Dependencies:** Phase 3 complete

- [x] Create comprehensive governance documentation
- [x] Develop developer workflow guides
- [x] Establish code review processes
- [x] Conduct team training sessions

## Validation and Success Criteria

**Success Metrics:**
- **100% Compliance Rate:** All new components within size guidelines
- **Zero Critical Violations:** No components >50% over limits in new code
- **Improved Development Velocity:** Faster component understanding and modification
- **Enhanced Code Review Efficiency:** Reduced review time for size-compliant components
- **Developer Satisfaction:** Positive team feedback on code clarity and maintainability

**Validation Methods:**
- Weekly compliance reports tracking violation trends
- Developer productivity surveys comparing before/after implementation
- Code review duration metrics
- Time-to-understanding measurements for new team members
- Monthly architecture review sessions assessing system effectiveness

## Compliance and Governance

**Component Size Guidelines:**
- Services: ≤500 lines (maintains testability and single responsibility)
- UI Widgets: ≤300 lines (promotes reusability and reduces complexity)
- Screen Components: ≤400 lines (allows complex layouts while maintaining structure)
- Modal Components: ≤250 lines (ensures focused, lightweight interactions)
- Models: Flexible (complex data structures acceptable)

**Architectural Alignment:**
- Enforces single responsibility principle
- Supports composition over inheritance
- Maintains clear separation of concerns
- Enables efficient testing strategies
- Facilitates team collaboration and knowledge sharing
