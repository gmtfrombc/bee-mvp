## 🚨 **Risks & Mitigation Strategies**

### **High Priority Risks**
1. **WordPress API Reliability**: External dependency may cause service interruptions
   - *Mitigation*: Robust caching, graceful degradation, and fallback mechanisms
   
2. **Content Caching Complexity**: Large content volumes may overwhelm local storage
   - *Mitigation*: Intelligent cache management with size limits and cleanup strategies

3. **Search Performance**: Full-text search may be slow with large content volumes
   - *Mitigation*: Optimized PostgreSQL indexing and search result pagination

### **Medium Priority Risks**
1. **Offline Sync Conflicts**: Simultaneous edits may cause data inconsistencies
   - *Mitigation*: Last-write-wins strategy with conflict detection and user notification

2. **Progress Tracking Accuracy**: Different content types may have tracking challenges
   - *Mitigation*: Multiple tracking methods and validation mechanisms

3. **Cross-platform Consistency**: WebView behavior may differ between iOS and Android
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive testing on both platforms with fallback solutions

### **Low Priority Risks**
1. **WordPress Plugin Compatibility**: CMS updates may break API integration
   - *Mitigation*: Version-locked API endpoints and update testing procedures

2. **Content Format Changes**: New content types may require additional handling
   - *Mitigation*: Extensible content type system with plugin architecture
