## 📋 **Epic Overview**

**Goal:** Build comprehensive wearable device integration infrastructure that
provides real-time physiological data streaming from multiple wearable
platforms, with enhanced medication adherence tracking, **directly supporting
the AI coaching system's ability to deliver just-in-time adaptive interventions
based on comprehensive health data**.

**Core Promise Alignment**: This epic provides the critical data foundation for
the BEE promise of real-time behavior change monitoring. By integrating
physiological data (heart rate, sleep, activity) with medication adherence
patterns, the AI coaching system can detect motivation changes at the earliest
possible moment and deliver precisely timed interventions when users need
support most.

**Success Criteria:**

- Multi-platform wearable device integration (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin,
  Samsung) consolidated by using Flutter `health` package
- **Early real data validation using test user (developer) Garmin Connect
  integration**
- Real-time physiological data streaming with <5 second latency
- Comprehensive data processing for heart rate, sleep patterns, and activity
  metrics
- Medication adherence tracking and pharmacy data integration will be deferred
  to future Epic
- Secure API endpoints for AI coaching system integration
- 95%+ data accuracy across all supported devices
- **Foundation for JITAI system enabling predictive interventions**
- **Early Epic 1.3 Phase 3 dependency resolution through minimal viable wearable
  data**
- Robust error handling and device compatibility validation
- HIPAA-compliant data handling and storage
- **Physiological data correlation with engagement patterns for motivation
  prediction**

**Key Innovation:** Unified wearable integration platform that combines
physiological monitoring to provide comprehensive health behavior context for
AI-powered behavior change interventions. **Enhanced with early real data
validation to accelerate Epic 1.3 dependency resolution and reduce integration
risks.**

**Strategic Importance:**

- **CRITICAL BLOCKER** for Epic 1.3 Phase 3 (Just-in-Time Adaptive
  Interventions)
- **FOUNDATIONAL** for motivation prediction and early warning systems
- **ESSENTIAL** for complete promise delivery of real-time behavior change
  monitoring

### **✅ T2.2.2.6 - Client-side VitalsNotifier Subscriber (COMPLETE)** 🔄 **NEW**

**Implemented Components:**

- **`VitalsNotifierService`** (core/services/) - Focused client-side subscriber
  bridging wearable streaming with UI/JITAI consumption
- **`VitalsNotifierProvider`** (core/providers/) - Riverpod providers for UI
  integration following established patterns
- **`VitalsTileWidget`** (core/widgets/) - Example UI widget demonstrating
  VitalsNotifier consumption
- **Essential Unit Tests** (test/core/services/) - 5 focused tests covering core
  business logic

**Key Features:**

- **Provider Pattern Integration**: Clean Riverpod integration for UI widgets
  and JITAI engine consumption
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Converts WearableLiveMessage into processed
  VitalsData with quality metrics
- **Quality Assessment**: VitalsQuality enum with
  excellence/good/fair/poor/unknown classification
- **UI Integration Ready**: Sample tile widget showing heart rate, steps, HRV
  with connection status
- **Modular Architecture**: Focused services following BEE component guidelines
  (no god services)

**Testing & Validation:**

- ✅ **5/5 unit tests passing** - Core VitalsQuality and data processing logic
  tested
- ✅ **Flutter analysis clean** - All linting issues resolved
- ✅ **Component guidelines adherence** - Service (368 lines), Provider (138
  lines), Widget (197 lines)
- ✅ **Modern Flutter practices** - No deprecated widgets, proper theme usage

**Risk Mitigation:**

- ✅ **Epic 1.3 JITAI Integration Ready** - Provider pattern enables direct AI
  coaching system integration
- ✅ **UI Widget Foundation** - Demonstrates real-time vitals consumption for
  dashboard development
- ✅ **Testing Infrastructure** - Essential test coverage following BEE ≥85%
  policy with quality focus

### **✅ T2.2.2.9 - Adaptive Polling Fallback (COMPLETE)** 🔄 **NEW**

**Implemented Components:**

- **`VitalsNotifierService` Modification** - Integrated polling logic using a
  `Timer` and the existing `WearableDataRepository`.
- **`AdaptivePollingToggle` Widget**
  (`features/momentum/presentation/widgets/`) - A new, self-contained UI
  component for enabling/disabling the feature.
- **`SharedPreferences` Integration** - Persists the user's choice for the
  adaptive polling setting.

**Key Features:**

- **User-Configurable Setting**: A simple toggle in the profile settings screen
  allows users to switch between real-time streaming and resource-saving
  polling.
- **Seamless Fallback**: The `VitalsNotifierService` now dynamically switches
  between WebSocket streaming and periodic polling based on the user's
  preference.
- **Improved Modularity**: The UI toggle was extracted into its own widget for
  better reusability and testability.

**Testing & Validation:**

- ✅ **Service-level unit tests** - Core logic for switching modes and
  stopping/starting subscriptions is verified.
- ✅ **Widget test** - The `AdaptivePollingToggle`'s state management and
  interaction with `SharedPreferences` are validated in isolation.
- ✅ **Simplified Testing Approach** - Adheres to the project's testing policy
  by focusing on simple, happy-path tests.

**Risk Mitigation:**

- ✅ **Addresses performance on older devices** - Reduces battery and CPU
  consumption for users who don't need real-time updates.
- ✅ **Improves user experience** - Provides users with more control over the
  app's resource usage.
