# Developer Prompts - Momentum Meter (Epic 1.1)

**Epic:** 1.1 Â· Momentum Meter  
**Module:** Core Mobile Experience  
**Purpose:** Task-specific prompts for AI-assisted development

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Epic Context**

**Goal:** Build a patient-facing motivation gauge that replaces traditional "engagement scores" with a friendly, three-state system designed to encourage rather than demotivate users.

**Key Innovation:** Uses positive states (Rising ðŸš€, Steady ðŸ™‚, Needs Care ðŸŒ±) instead of numerical scores to provide encouraging feedback and trigger timely interventions.

**Integration:** Builds on Epic 2.1 (Engagement Events Logging) to create the primary motivational interface for the BEE platform.
