# Streak Tracking Service Architecture

## Overview

The Streak Tracking Service has been refactored from a monolithic 1,010-line service into a modular architecture with 5 focused services. This architecture provides better maintainability, testability, and adherence to single responsibility principles.

## Service Interaction Patterns

### Dependency Injection
```dart
class TodayFeedStreakTrackingService {
  late final StreakPersistenceService _persistenceService;
  late final StreakCalculationService _calculationService;
  late final StreakMilestoneService _milestoneService;
  late final StreakAnalyticsService _analyticsService;
  
  Future<void> initialize() async {
    _persistenceService = StreakPersistenceService();
    _calculationService = StreakCalculationService();
    _milestoneService = StreakMilestoneService();
    _analyticsService = StreakAnalyticsService();
    
    await _persistenceService.initialize();
    await _calculationService.initialize();
    await _milestoneService.initialize();
    await _analyticsService.initialize();
  }
}
```

### Service Communication Flow
```
User Engagement Event
        ↓
Main Service (Coordinator)
        ↓
Calculation Service → Persistence Service
        ↓                    ↓
Milestone Service ← Analytics Service
        ↓
Momentum Integration
        ↓
UI Update + Celebration
```

### Error Handling Pattern
Each service implements consistent error handling:
- Try-catch blocks with proper error logging
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- Offline queue for sync failures
- Fallback mechanisms for service unavailability

## Configuration

### Constants and Thresholds
```dart
// Milestone thresholds (in StreakMilestoneService)
static const List<int> milestoneThresholds = [3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 100, 200, 365];

// Cache TTL (in StreakPersistenceService)
static const Duration cacheExpiry = Duration(minutes: 30);

// Analytics periods (in StreakAnalyticsService)
static const int defaultAnalysisPeriod = 90; // days
```

### Service Initialization Order
1. StreakPersistenceService (data layer foundation)
2. StreakCalculationService (depends on persistence)
3. StreakMilestoneService (depends on calculation + persistence)
4. StreakAnalyticsService (depends on persistence)
5. Main Service (coordinates all services)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach
Each service is tested independently:
- **Persistence Service:** Database operations, cache management, sync queue
- **Calculation Service:** Streak algorithms, edge cases, timezone handling
- **Milestone Service:** Threshold detection, celebration creation, bonus integration
- **Analytics Service:** Calculation accuracy, insights generation, recommendations
- **Main Service:** Service coordination, API behavior, error handling

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end streak tracking flow
- Cross-service data consistency
- Error handling under service failures
- Performance under load

## Migration Guide

### From Monolithic to Modular
The refactoring maintains 100% API compatibility:
- All public method signatures unchanged
- Identical behavior and return types
- Same error handling patterns
- Preserved performance characteristics

### Usage Examples
```dart
// Get current streak (unchanged usage)
final streak = await TodayFeedStreakTrackingService().getCurrentStreak(userId);

// Update streak on engagement (unchanged usage)
final result = await TodayFeedStreakTrackingService().updateStreakOnEngagement(
  userId: userId,
  content: content,
  sessionDuration: duration,
);

// Get analytics (unchanged usage)
final analytics = await TodayFeedStreakTrackingService().getStreakAnalytics(userId);
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Service Coordination Overhead
- Minimal latency increase (<5ms) due to service delegation
- Memory usage optimized through proper service lifecycle management
- Cache efficiency improved through specialized persistence service

### Scalability Improvements
- Individual service scaling and optimization
- Easier performance profiling and bottleneck identification
- Modular caching strategies per service responsibility

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features
1. Identify the appropriate service based on responsibility
2. Add new methods to the specific service
3. Update main service to expose public API if needed
4. Add comprehensive unit tests for the service
5. Update integration tests as needed

### Service Modification Rules
- Maintain single responsibility per service
- Keep services under 500-line limit
- Use dependency injection for cross-service communication
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Add unit tests for all new functionality

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow Flutter/Dart style guidelines
- Use consistent error handling patterns
- Implement proper resource disposal
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Ensure test coverage >85%

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- Service interface abstractions for better testability
- Event-driven communication between services
- Advanced caching strategies with multiple storage layers
- Real-time analytics with streaming capabilities
- A/B testing framework for milestone celebrations

### Extensibility Points
- Custom milestone threshold configuration
- Pluggable celebration templates
- External analytics integration
- Custom streak calculation algorithms
- Third-party momentum point systems
